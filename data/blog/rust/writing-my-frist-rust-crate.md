Rust is probably the most popular language on StackOverflow for six years in a row[^1]. The design pattern in rust is both familiar and unique to many other languages, `OBRM`(Ownership Based Resource Management) vs `RAII` in C++, type system and functional expression in Haskell. The concept of `lifetime`, I think is unique to rust. All the features combine, make rust a memory-safe and high-performance language(and cross-platform compatibility!).

Enough compliments on the language itself. Anyway, all the features that rust provides allow us to write high-performance and memory-safe programs at the system level. I was about to finish my Master's Thesis on a learned spatial index, and I discover a lot of paper implementations are in rust, so I decided to give it a try.

# The Learned Spatial Index

The aim of this post is not to provide information about spatial index or learned index in depth. Therefore, I can briefly go through related concepts in this field.
